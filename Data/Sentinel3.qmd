The [Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3){target="_blank"} is an European Earth Observation satellite mission developed to support Copernicus ocean, land, atmospheric, emergency, security and cryospheric applications. It's main objective is to measure sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, and ocean and land surface colour with high accuracy and reliability to support ocean forecasting systems, environmental monitoring and climate monitoring. The mission definition is driven by the need for continuity in provision of ERS, ENVISAT and SPOT vegetation data, with improvements in instrument performance and coverage.
