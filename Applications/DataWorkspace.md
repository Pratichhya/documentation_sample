# About Data Workspace

The Data Workspace is a valuable tool for managing and reviewing Earth observation-related products. This platform enables you to aggregate and review products, which can then be further processed or downloaded for various purposes.

The Data Workspace allows for the management ordering of the products. Offline products can be ordered and their retrieval progress can be monitored in the ‘Order Status’ section. Online products can be selected for processing with higher-level processors or downloaded.

When the products are selected for processing, you are provided with a list of processors that are capable of processing relevant data types. The processors can be further parameterized to fine-tune the results

Once the order for processing is submitted, the progress can be monitored similarly to orders for product retrieval. The status dashboards also include all orders submitted through the ordering API. The status of the orders can be monitored on the status page, and the orders can be updated while being executed, providing the flexibility to cancel unnecessary tasks.

You can familiarise yourself with workspace and access it at [https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/workspace/](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/workspace/){target="_blank"}
